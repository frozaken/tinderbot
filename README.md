<h1>Match your tindermatches!</h1>
<p>This bot, will match your matches, and let them write to oneanother. All you need to do, is set up a mongodb(preferrably on 127.0.0.1), enter you information in the config.py file, and run main.py with python3. The code is missing a lot of error checking, and is not designed to be clean, nor efficient. All in all, the code sucks... but it works.</p>
<br/>
<p>And btw, the old accounts used in the history of the config files have been deleted, don't even try.</p>
